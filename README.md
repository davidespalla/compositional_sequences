# compositional_sequences

Code to study the effect of compositionality on sequential autoassociative memory networks.

- `PatternStructure` defines the structure of memory patterns and their interactions

- `AssociativeNetwork` defines an associative network class to handle the dynamics

- `Order parameters` (under construction) implements calculations of order parameters and metrics
